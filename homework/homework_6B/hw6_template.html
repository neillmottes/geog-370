<h1>Homework 6b Ratios </h1>

<h3>Percent of families with kids under 18. Idaho 26911 projection. </h3>
<h3>I divided the number of families by the number of families with kids and multiplied it by 100 to get the percentage.  We can see that the more rural the county is, the fewer kids families have.
    The classification scheme for this map is the equal interval. The classification makes the differences appear more significant then they are. In addition, in this classification, I did not select the value of the interval, but the number of internal and QGIS calculated the value.</h3>
