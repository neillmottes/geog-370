<h3>Percent of families with kids under 18. Idaho 26911 projection. </h3>
<h4>I divided the number of families by the number of families with kids and multiplied it by 100 to get the percentage.  We can see that the more rural the county is, the fewer kids families have.
    The classification scheme for this map is the equal interval. The classification makes the differences appear more significant then they are. In addition, in this classification, I did not select the value of the interval, but the number of internal and QGIS calculated the value.</h4>

    <h3>Percent of self identified white families. Idaho 26911 projection. </h3>
    <h4>I divided the number of families by the number of self-identified white famlies and multiplied it by 100 to get the percentage. We can see that Idaho has a high percentage of self-identified families. The classification scheme for this map is the Fixed interval. The classification makes the differences appear more significant than they are. A difference between this and the first map is that I chose the value of the interval, and QGIS calculated the number of intervals. </h4>

    <h3>self identified black famlies per 10,000 famlies. Idaho 26911 projection. </h3>
    <h4>I divided the number of families by the number of self-identified black families and multiplied it by 10,000 to get the number of black families per 10,00 families. We can see that in most counties in Idaho there are less than 50 black families for 10,000  families 
        The classification scheme for this map is pretty breaks. The classification uses numbers that are easier for the reader to read. Yet, because most values are under 50, we cannot see the differences between most counties.  </h4>
