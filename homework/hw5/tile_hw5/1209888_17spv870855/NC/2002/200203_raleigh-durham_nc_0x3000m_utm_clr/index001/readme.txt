Metadata in this directory is stored in XML format using the FGDC content standard. 

Each XML file contains a reference to the stylesheet 'FGDC_V2.xsl' which when viewed
with IE5.5 or greater translates the XML file into an HTML format suitable for 
reading and printing.

	csdgm2.dtd      - The Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata
	FGDC_V2.xsl     - XSL Stylesheet for reformatting XML content.
	*****.xml       - The actual FGDC metadata file in XML format.

To copy these metadata (.xml) files from the current directory make sure to include 
the .dtd and .xsl files listed above.
