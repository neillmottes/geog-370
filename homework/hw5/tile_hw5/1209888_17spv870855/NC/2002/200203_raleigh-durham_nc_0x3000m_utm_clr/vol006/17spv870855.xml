      <abstract>An orthoimage is remotely sensed image data in which displacement of features in the image caused by terrain relief and sensor orientation have been mathematically removed. Orthoimagery combines the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map. For this dataset, the natural color orthoimages were produced at 0.3-meter pixel resolution (approximately 1-foot). The design accuracy is estimated not to exceed 3-meter diagonal RMSE (2.12m RMSE in X or Y). Each orthoimage provides imagery for a 1500- by 1500-meter block on the ground. The projected coordinate system is UTM with a NAD83 datum. There is no image overlap between adjacent files. The naming convention is based on the U.S. National Grid (USNG), taking the coordinates of the SW corner of the orthoimage.</abstract>
      <purpose>This data has been created as a result of the need for having geospatial data immediately available and easily accessible in order to enhance the capability of Federal, State, and local emergency responders, as well as plan for homeland security efforts.</purpose>

    <attracc>
      <attraccr>During photographic reproduction of the source photographs, limited analog dodging (radiometric editing) is performed to improve image quality. Analog dodging consists of holding back light from certain areas of the sensitized photographic material to avoid overexposure. The diapositive is inspected to ensure clarity and radiometric uniformity. Diapositive image brightness values are collected with a minimum of image quality manipulation. Image brightness values may deviate from the brightness values of the original images because of image value interpolation during the scanning and rectification processes. Radiometry is verified by visual inspection of the digital orthophoto with the original unrectified image to determine if the digital orthophoto has the same or better image quality as the original unrectified input image. Slight systematic radiometric differences can be detected between adjacent orthoimage files; these are due primarily to differences in source photograph capture dates and sun angles along flight lines when the aerial photographs were taken. These differences can be observed in an image's general lightness or darkness when it is compared to adjacent orthoimage file coverages. Tonal balancing may be performed over a group of images during the mosaicking process which may serve to lighten or darken adjacent images for better color tone matching.</attraccr>

          The horizontal positional accuracy and the assurance of that accuracy depend, in part, on the accuracy of the data inputs to the rectification process.  The location of existing USGS photoidentifiable ground control and contractor aerotriangulation points were evaluated on the Geotiff image and compared with their ground values in order to determine an overall accuracy for each test block of orthoimages within the project.   After image coordinate measurement was completed for each block, an RMSE for the diagonal error was calculated for the orthoimages within the block.  This value is an estimate of the horizontal accuracy of the tile expressed in meters.

          Each image was scanned from film-stable source at a resolution of 20 micrometers. Airborne GPS provided the camera station X, Y, and Z coordinates and was used to control a softcopy aerotriangulation block solution. Available USGS photoidentifiable ground control was used to test the results of the aerotriangulation adjustment. External orientation parameters derived from the aerotriangulation solution were used to provide the horizontal control for each photograph. Vertical control for the orthorectification process was obtained from both LIDAR and existing USGS Digitial Elevation Models (DEM). During the orthorectification process, elevation data were extracted and resampled to meet user-specified intervals and bounds.

The orthorectified imagery is resampled to a 0.3 meter ground resolution with a ground extent of 1500- by 1500-meters. Each 1500- by 1500-meter orthoimage is generated from a mosaic created from multiple photographs. Tonal balancing is automatically performed over each work block of contiguous images during the mosaicking process. However, a single tonal balancing operation was not performed over the project area in its entirety. Orthorectification and mosaicking were performed using Z/I Imaging OrthoPro 4.00.00.05 running on Windows 2000 SP2. Resampling to 0.3 meter was done using cubic convolution. Individual orthoimages are bounded by UTM grid lines which are evenly divisible by 1500. Final output is as an uncompressed GeoTiff file.

All orthoimages are individually inspected for content, misalignments along mosaic seamlines, and void areas. No digital image dodging or enhancement was performed. Source information was collected and verified manually during the production process.
